1. Introduction

Hello, I'm ADJADI Axel, a web developer based in France.
I discover the word of programming with Javascript, and now I mostly code with React.js .

I'm junior at this level but I have already developed several projects on my own mostly for training. But know I'm feeling ready to work with you and show you all my skills.

3. When I first discover the React ecosystem I quickly appreciate the component-based approach that it offers to build user interfaces. I'm enjoying the fact that we easily can use libraries with it like react-redux, I also appreciate the used of hooks that offer a lot of adaptability.
